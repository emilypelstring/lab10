## beepr beeps 

Use the function `beep()` in the beepr package to make an audio alert when your code is done running. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
for (i in rev(seq(1:99))) {
  
  print(paste(i, "bottles on beer on the wall"))
}

beep(4)
```

## praise and cowsay

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun. 

```{r}
praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAMATION}...${exclamation}!!!!")

praise("Holy ${creating}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you. 

```{r}
say("This is awesome!", by = "shark")
```
